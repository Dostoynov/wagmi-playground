# Wagmi Playground

This repository hosts a collection of experimental React/TypeScript interfaces built with Vite to explore wagmi, ethers v6, and related delegation scenarios. The UI currently includes several laboratory screens: a bytecode size explorer, an ERC-1271 signature validator, and an EIP-7702 delegation prototype.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Production build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Static artifacts are emitted into the `dist/` directory, which can be published directly to GitHub Pages or any other static host. To verify the bundle locally, run `pnpm preview`.

## Project structure

- `src/` – application source code and experiments
- `public/` – static assets copied into the bundle (favicon and robots.txt)
- `dist/` – build output generated by `pnpm build`

## Publishing the build to GitHub Pages

Run the helper script to rebuild the project, switch to the target branch (defaults to `gh-pages`), purge previous artifacts, and place the new static files in the branch root:

```bash
node scripts/publish-build.js
```

Optional positional parameters allow overriding the branch name, build directory, and build command respectively, for example:

```bash
node scripts/publish-build.js gh-pages dist "pnpm build"
```

## Indexing policy

The site is intended for internal experimentation only. The markup includes `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow, noarchive">`, and `public/robots.txt` denies crawling to prevent the pages from appearing in search results.
